# Core Dart 101
 Flutter is not a language, rather an SDK just like Android SDKÐ± but Dart is the official programming language. Let's write 100,000 lines of code for strong junior level!

:warning: Please note that you mustn't open PRs that contains the answers to this repo!

However, PRs with the fixes or proposals are welcomed!

# Task
The task is to implement functions on different Core Dart topics. There are eight modules with different tasks. Each module consists of tasks for specified topic:

Strings
Numbers
Arrays
Date
Objects
Streams
Conditions and Loops
Functions and Closures

### Active usage of documentation is strongly recommended!
 >go to the tasks folder and open project: ~/Core-Dart-101/string_tatsks$ cd string_tatsks
 >go to lib folder and file .dart with tasks, solve them, and then go to the next folder, number_tasks for example
 >and proceed in a similar way
